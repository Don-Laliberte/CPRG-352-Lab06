# CPRG-352-Lab06
This repo contains one of my Labs from my Web Dev course at SAIT. This Web-Application takes logged-in users to an interface where they can add items to a shopping list from a pre-existing SQL database. Admins can tweak the stock and prices from a secure interface.
# What I learned
•Implementing a smart SQL table structure

•Utilizing JDBC efficiently to pull data into a table for the user

•Updating SQL entries in close to real time (Unfortunately this isn't react)

•Security implementatations for preventing malicious entries in the database. For example: An item gets added with an ID of -999

•Security Filters for administrative pages so unauthorized users get redirected
